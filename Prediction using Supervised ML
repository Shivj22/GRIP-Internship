# Prediction using Supervised ML using R.
# Data Set: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv

# Prediction of scores based on no. of hours of study


# Import Data Set

Marks_Scored<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv")
View(Marks_Scored)

# Lets check the relationship between both the variables
# We will use a scatter plot graph to determine the relationship between both the variables

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Marks_Scored,aes(x=Hours, y=Scores))+geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)+xlab("Hours")+ylab("Scores")


# From the graph, we can see that both variables have a positive linear relationship

# Lets divide the data set into 2 partitions
# 1 - Training Data, 2 - Testing Data
# The partition would be 75-25

set.seed(200)

index<-sample(nrow(Marks_Scored),0.75*nrow(Marks_Scored))

# Training Data

Training_Data<-Marks_Scored[index,]

# Testing Data

Testing_Data<-Marks_Scored[-index,]

# Now, lets create a linear regression model using training data

linear_model<-lm(Scores~Hours,data = Training_Data)
summary(linear_model)
# p-value: 4.695e-12 < 0.05
# Hence, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant relationship between both the variables

# Implementing the model on training data to predict scores

Training_Data$Predicted_Scores<-predict(linear_model,Training_Data)
head(Training_Data)

# Calculate RMSE

library(Metrics)

rmse(Training_Data$Predicted_Scores,Training_Data$Scores)

# 5.427421 - Training Data

# Implementing the model on the testing data

Testing_Data$Predicted_Scores<-predict(linear_model,Testing_Data)
head(Testing_Data)


# Calculate RMSE

rmse(Testing_Data$Predicted_Scores,Testing_Data$Scores)

# 5.263304 - Testing Data


# We can see that both the RMSEs are very similar or the difference between both the RMSEs is very less
# Therefore, we can consider our model as a good fit


# Now, we can use our model to predict the score if the number of hours of study are 9.25hrs/day

# For that, we have to create a data frame containing the no of hours

Marks<-as.data.frame(9.25)
colnames(Marks)<- "Hours"
Marks


# Lets implement our model

Marks$SCores<-predict(linear_model,Marks)

Marks
round(Marks$SCores,digits = 2)



# Predicted Score for 9.25 hrs/day = 92.85
